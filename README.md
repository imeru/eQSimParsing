# eQuest *.SIM Parsing #

### Parsing and using the SIM file ###

As of today, will correctly parse the SV-A, PV-A, BEPS (for unmet hours) and the PS-B report.

Is included in this repository the `eqsimparsing.py` which is where the functions are defined.

The IPython Notebook is provided as an example of how to use it (with an example *.SIM file and the two .csv outputs)
